## Description
This is a project that focuses on the usage of forms. It is a simple form page for a fake coffee club that asks for the users' name, email, number, and a password. Email and password validation has been added to provide feedback for the user when there is a problem. It was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The most challenging part of the project was learning RegEx as part of validating form inputs. This project could be further improved by attaching it to an actual backend and making it store data.
